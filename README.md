The official repository of the Software Quality Model for Machine Learning.

The repository contains the documentation for the Software Quality Model for Machine Learning 
(found in the `docs` directory),
as well as the source code (in the `code` directory) used to generate the results presented in the paper _"How Good Are Your Best Practices?
A Framework to Prioritize Software Quality Practices for Machine Learning Systems"_.


The code contains the notebook `results.ipynb` which includes all the results that are presented in the paper. To 
reproduce the results, follow instructions found in the README.md in the `code` directory.
